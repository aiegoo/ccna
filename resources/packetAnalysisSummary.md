>Chapter 1: Packet Analysis and Network Basics
What is packet analysis? How does it work? How do you do it? This chapter
covers the very basics of network communication and packet analysis.

>Chapter 2: Tapping into the Wire
This chapter covers the different techniques you can use to place a <code>packet sniffer </code> on your network.tcpdump / OmniPeek / Wireshark

>Chapter 3: Introduction to Wireshark
Here we’ll look at the basics of Wireshark—where to get it, how to use it,
what it does, why it’s great, and all of that good stuff.

>Chapter 4: Working with Captured Packets
Once you get Wireshark up and running, you will want to know the
basics of interacting with captured packets. This is where you’ll learn.

>Chapter 5: Advanced Wireshark Features
Once you have learned to crawl, it’s time to take off running with the
advanced Wireshark features. This chapter delves into these features and
goes under the hood to show you things that aren’t always so apparent.

>Chapter 6: Common Protocols
This chapter shows what some of the most common network communication
protocols look like at the packet level. In order to understand
how these protocols can malfunction, you first have to understand how
they work.

>Chapter 7: Basic Case Scenarios
This chapter contains the first set of real-world case scenarios. Each
scenario is presented in an easy-to-follow format, where for each scenario
the problem, my analysis, and a solution are given. These basic scenarios
deal with only a few computers and involve a limited amount of analysis—
just enough to get your feet wet.

>Chapter 8: Fighting a Slow Network
The most common problems network technicians hear about generally
involve slow network performance. This chapter is devoted to solving
these types of problems.

>Chapter 9: Security-based Analysis
Network security is the biggest hot-button topic in network administration.
Because of this, Chapter 9 shows you the ins and outs of solving securityrelated issues with packet analysis techniques.

>Chapter 10: Sniffing into Thin Air
The last chapter of the practical section of the book is a primer on wireless
packet analysis. This chapter discusses the differences between wireless
analysis and wired analysis and includes a quick case scenario that reinforces
what you’ve learned.

>Chapter 11: Further Reading
The final chapter of the book sums up what you have learned and
includes some other reference tools and websites you might find useful
as you continue to use the packet analysis techniques you have learned.
